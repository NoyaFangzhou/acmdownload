Although time plays a central role in the physical world, all widely used software abstractions lack temporal semantics. The notion of correct execution of a program written in every widely-used programming language today does not depend on the temporal behavior of the program.

abstract = {Next-generation non-volatile memories (NVMs) promise DRAM-like performance, persistence, and high density. They can attach directly to processors to form non-volatile main memory (NVMM) and offer the opportunity to build very low-latency storage systems. These high-performance storage systems would be especially useful in large-scale data center environments where reliability and availability are critical. However, providing reliability and availability to NVMM is challenging, since the latency of data replication can overwhelm the low latency that NVMM should provide. We propose Mojim, a system that provides the reliability and availability that large-scale storage systems require, while preserving the performance of NVMM. Mojim achieves these goals by using a two-tier architecture in which the primary tier contains a mirrored pair of nodes and the secondary tier contains one or more secondary backup nodes with weakly consistent copies of data. Mojim uses highly-optimized replication protocols, software, and networking stacks to minimize replication costs and expose as much of NVMM?s performance as possible. We evaluate Mojim using raw DRAM as a proxy for NVMM and using an industrial NVMM emulation system. We find that Mojim provides replicated NVMM with similar or even better performance than un-replicated NVMM (reducing latency by 27% to 63% and delivering between 0.4 to 2.7X the throughput). We demonstrate that replacing MongoDB's built-in replication system with Mojim improves MongoDB's performance by 3.4 to 4X.},

abstract = {Phase Change Memory (PCM) has better scalability and smaller cell size comparing to DRAM. However, further scaling PCM cell in deep sub-micron regime results in significant thermal based write disturbance (WD). Naively allocating large inter-cell space increases cell size from 4F2 ideal to 12F2. While a recent work mitigates WD along word-lines through disturbance resilient data encoding, it is ineffective for WD along bit-lines, which is more severe due to widely adopted $mu$Trench structure in constructing PCM cell arrays. Without mitigating WD along bit-lines, a PCM cell still has 8F2, which is 100% larger than the ideal. In this paper, we propose SD-PCM for achieving reliable write operations in super dense PCM. In particular, we focus on mitigating WD along bit-lines such that we can construct super dense PCM chips with 4F2 cell size, i.e., the minimal for diode-switch based PCM. Based on simple verification-n-correction (VnC), we propose LazyCorrection and PreRead to effectively reduce VnC overhead and minimize cascading verification during write. We further propose (n:m)-Alloc for achieving good tradeoff between VnC overhead minimization and memory capacity loss. Our experimental results show that, comparing to a WD-free low density PCM, SD-PCM achieves 80% capacity improvement in cell arrays while incurring around 0-10% performance degradation when using different (n:m) allocators.},

While the non-volatility of PCM is a desirable property in order to save leakage power, it also has the undesirable effect of making PCM main memories susceptible to newer modes of security vulnerabilities, for example, accessibility to sensitive data if a PCM DIMM gets stolen. PCM memories can be made secure by encrypting the data. Unfortunately, such encryption comes with a significant overhead in terms of bits written to PCM memory, causing half of the bits in the line to change on every write, even if the actual number of bits being written to memory is small. Our studies show that a typical writeback modifies, on average, only 12% of the bits in the cacheline. Thus, encryption causes almost a 4x increase in the number of bits written to PCM memories. Such extraneous bit writes cause significant increase in write power, reduction in write endurance, and reduction in write bandwidth. To provide the benefit of secure memory in a write efficient manner this paper proposes Dual Counter Encryption (DEUCE). DEUCE is based on the observation that a typical writeback only changes a few words, so DEUCE reencrypts only the words that have changed.

abstract = {This paper introduces a temporally bounded total store ordering (TBTSO) memory model, and shows that it enables nonblocking fence-free solutions to asymmetric synchronization problems, such as those arising in memory reclamation and biased locking.TBTSO strengthens the TSO memory model by bounding the time it takes a store to drain from the store buffer into memory. This bound enables devising fence-free algorithms for asymmetric problems, which require a performance-critical fast path to synchronize with an infrequently executed slow path. We demonstrate this by constructing (1) a fence-free version of the hazard pointers memory reclamation scheme, and (2) a fence-free biased lock algorithm which is compatible with unmanaged environments as it does not rely on safe points or similar mechanisms.We further argue that TBTSO can be implemented in hardware with modest modifications to existing TSO architectures. However, our design makes assumptions about proprietary implementation details of commercial hardware; it thus best serves as a starting point for a discussion on the feasibility of hardware TBTSO implementation. We also show how minimal OS support enables the adaptation of TBTSO algorithms to x86 systems.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a temporally bounded total store ordering (TBTSO) memory model, and shows that it enables nonblocking fence-free solutions to asymmetric synchronization problems, such as those arising in memory reclamation and biased locking.TBTSO strengthens the TSO memory model by bounding the time it takes a store to drain from the store buffer into memory. This bound enables devising fence-free algorithms for asymmetric problems, which require a performance-critical fast path to synchronize with an infrequently executed slow path. We demonstrate this by constructing (1) a fence-free version of the hazard pointers memory reclamation scheme, and (2) a fence-free biased lock algorithm which is compatible with unmanaged environments as it does not rely on safe points or similar mechanisms.We further argue that TBTSO can be implemented in hardware with modest modifications to existing TSO architectures. However, our design makes assumptions about proprietary implementation details of commercial hardware; it thus best serves as a starting point for a discussion on the feasibility of hardware TBTSO implementation. We also show how minimal OS support enables the adaptation of TBTSO algorithms to x86 systems.},

Scoped synchronization works well for static sharing patterns, where consumer threads are known a priori. It works poorly for dynamic sharing patterns (e.g., work stealing) where programmers cannot use a faster small scope due to the rare possibility that the work is stolen by a thread in a distant slower scope.

In this paper, we propose to extend scoped synchronization with remote-scope promotion. This allows the most frequent sharers to synchronize through a small scope.

Synchronization using remote-scope promotion provides performance robustness for dynamic workloads, where the benefits provided by scoped synchronization and work stealing are hard to anticipate.

GhostRider ensures all programs satisfy a property called memory-trace obliviousness (MTO): Even an adversary that observes memory, bus traffic, and access times while the program executes can learn nothing about the program's sensitive inputs and outputs.

This baseline approach can be inefficient, and so GhostRider's compiler uses a program analysis to do better, allocating data to non-oblivious, encrypted RAM (ERAM) and employing a scratchpad when doing so will not compromise MTO. The compiler can also allocate to multiple ORAM banks, which sometimes significantly reduces access times.We have formalized our approach and proved it enjoys MTO.

A big challenge for hardware ORAM schemes is how to efficiently manage the Position Map (PosMap), a central component in modern ORAM algorithms. Implemented naively, the PosMap causes ORAM to be fundamentally unscalable in terms of on-chip area. On the other hand, a technique called Recursive ORAM fixes the area problem yet significantly increases ORAM's performance overhead.To address this challenge, we propose three new mechanisms. We propose a new ORAM structure called the PosMap Lookaside Buffer (PLB) and PosMap compression techniques to reduce the performance overhead from Recursive ORAM empirically (the latter also improves the construction asymptotically). Through simulation, we show that these techniques reduce the memory bandwidth overhead needed to support recursion by 95%, reduce overall ORAM bandwidth by 37% and improve overall SPEC benchmark performance by 1.27x. We then show how our PosMap compression techniques further facilitate an extremely efficient integrity verification scheme for ORAM which we call PosMap MAC (PMMAC). For a practical parameterization, PMMAC reduces the amount of hashing needed for integrity checking by &gt;= 68x relative to prior schemes and introduces only 7% performance overhead.We prototype our mechanisms in hardware and report area and clock frequency for a complete ORAM design post-synthesis and post-layout using an ASIC flow in a 32~nm commercial process. With 2 DRAM channels, the design post-layout runs at 1~GHz and has a total area of .47~mm2. Depending on PLB-specific parameters, the PLB accounts for 10% to 26% area.

abstract = {This paper presents PARD, a programmable architecture for resourcing-on-demand that provides a new programming interface to convey an application's high-level information like quality-of-service requirements to the hardware. PARD enables new functionalities like fully hardware-supported virtualization and differentiated services in computers. PARD is inspired by the observation that a computer is inherently a network in which hardware components communicate via packets (e.g., over the NoC or PCIe). We apply principles of software-defined networking to this intra-computer network and address three major challenges. First, to deal with the semantic gap between high-level applications and underlying hardware packets, PARD attaches a high-level semantic tag (e.g., a virtual machine or thread ID) to each memory-access, I/O, or interrupt packet. Second, to make hardware components more manageable, PARD implements programmable control planes that can be integrated into various shared resources (e.g., cache, DRAM, and I/O devices) and can differentially process packets according to tag-based rules. Third, to facilitate programming, PARD abstracts all control planes as a device file tree to provide a uniform programming interface via which users create and apply tag-based rules.Full-system simulation results show that by co-locating latencycritical memcached applications with other workloads PARD can improve a four-core computer's CPU utilization by up to a factor of four without significantly increasing tail latency. FPGA emulation based on a preliminary RTL implementation demonstrates that the cache control plane introduces no extra latency and that the memory control plane can reduce queueing delay for high-priority memory-access requests by up to a factor of 5.6.},

Unfortunately, bare-metal instances require time-consuming or OS-specific tasks for deployment due to the lack of virtualization layers, thereby sacrificing several beneficial features of traditional IaaS clouds such as agility, elasticity, and OS transparency. We present BMcast, an OS deployment system with a special-purpose de-virtualizable virtual machine monitor (VMM) that supports quick and OS-transparent startup of bare-metal instances. BMcast performs streaming OS deployment while allowing direct access to physical hardware from the guest OS, and then disappears after completing the deployment. Quick startup of instances improves agility and elasticity significantly, and OS transparency greatly simplifies management tasks for cloud customers. Experimental results have confirmed that BMcast initiated a bare-metal instance 8.6 times faster than image copying, and database performance on BMcast during streaming OS deployment was comparable to that on a state-of-the-art VMM without performing deployment. BMcast incurred zero overhead after de-virtualization.},

abstract = {Interactive services, such as Web search, recommendations, games, and finance, must respond quickly to satisfy customers. Achieving this goal requires optimizing tail (e.g., 99th+ percentile) latency. Although every server is multicore, parallelizing individual requests to reduce tail latency is challenging because (1) service demand is unknown when requests arrive; (2) blindly parallelizing all requests quickly oversubscribes hardware resources; and (3) parallelizing the numerous short requests will not improve tail latency. This paper introduces Few-to-Many (FM) incremental parallelization, which dynamically increases parallelism to reduce tail latency. FM uses request service demand profiles and hardware parallelism in an offline phase to compute a policy, represented as an interval table, which specifies when and how much software parallelism to add. At runtime, FM adds parallelism as specified by the interval table indexed by dynamic system load and request execution time progress. The longer a request executes, the more parallelism FM adds. We evaluate FM in Lucene, an open-source enterprise search engine, and in Bing, a commercial Web search engine. FM improves the 99th percentile response time up to 32% in Lucene and up to 26% in Bing, compared to prior state-of-the-art parallelization. Compared to running requests sequentially in Bing, FM improves tail latency by a factor of two. These results illustrate that incremental parallelism is a powerful tool for reducing tail latency.},

abstract = {Smartphones and tablets are easily lost or stolen. This makes them susceptible to an inexpensive class of memory attacks, such as cold-boot attacks, using a bus monitor to observe the memory bus, and DMA attacks. This paper describes Sentry, a system that allows applications and OS components to store their code and data on the System-on-Chip (SoC) rather than in DRAM. We use ARM-specific mechanisms originally designed for embedded systems, but still present in today's mobile devices, to protect applications and OS subsystems from memory attacks.},

The nested kernel operating system architecture addresses this problem by "nesting" a small isolated kernel within a traditional monolithic kernel. The "nested kernel" interposes on all updates to virtual memory translations to assert protections on physical memory, thus significantly reducing the trusted computing base for memory access control enforcement. We incorporated the nested kernel architecture into FreeBSD on x86-64 hardware while allowing the entire operating system, including untrusted components, to operate at the highest hardware privilege level by write-protecting MMU translations and de-privileging the untrusted part of the kernel. Our implementation inherently enforces kernel code integrity while still allowing dynamically loaded kernel modules, thus defending against code injection attacks. We also demonstrate that the nested kernel architecture allows kernel developers to isolate memory in ways not possible in monolithic kernels by introducing write-mediation and write-logging services to protect critical system data structures. Performance of the nested kernel prototype shows modest overheads: &lt;1% average for Apache and 2.7% for kernel compile. Overall, our results and experience show that the nested kernel design can be retrofitted to existing monolithic kernels, providing important security benefits.},

It is an open question how future server architectures should evolve to enable this emerging class of applications, and the lack of an open-source IPA workload is an obstacle in addressing this question. In this paper, we present the design of Sirius, an open end-to-end IPA web-service application that accepts queries in the form of voice and images, and responds with natural language. We then use this workload to investigate the implications of four points in the design space of future accelerator-based server architectures spanning traditional CPUs, GPUs, manycore throughput co-processors, and FPGAs.To investigate future server designs for Sirius, we decompose Sirius into a suite of 7 benchmarks (Sirius Suite) comprising the computationally intensive bottlenecks of Sirius. We port Sirius Suite to a spectrum of accelerator platforms and use the performance and power trade-offs across these platforms to perform a total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis of various server design points. In our study, we find that accelerators are critical for the future scalability of IPA services. Our results show that GPU- and FPGA-accelerated servers improve the query latency on average by 10x and 16x. For a given throughput, GPU- and FPGA-accelerated servers can reduce the TCO of datacenters by 2.6x and 1.4x, respectively.},

It is therefore vital for system energy efficiency that idle devices can enter a low-power state while still meeting the performance expectation. This is called device runtime Power Management (PM) for which individual device drivers in commodity OSes are held responsible today.

This paper identifies three pieces of information as essential to device runtime PM, and shows that they can be obtained without involving drivers, either by using a software-only approach, or more efficiently, by adding one register bit to each device. We thus suggest a structural change to the current Linux runtime PM framework, replacing the PM code in all applicable drivers with a single kernel module called the central PM agent. Experimental evaluations show that the central PM agent is just as effective as hand-tuned driver PM code. The paper also presents a tool called PowerAdvisor that simplifies driver PM efforts under the current Linux runtime PM framework. PowerAdvisor analyzes execution traces and suggests where to insert PM calls in driver source code. Despite being a best-effort tool, PowerAdvisor not only reproduces hand-tuned PM code from stock drivers, but also correctly suggests PM code never known before. Overall, our experience shows that it is promising to ultimately free driver developers from manual PM.},

abstract = {Molecular-scale Network-on-Chip (mNoC) crossbars use quantum dot LEDs as an on-chip light source, and chromophores to provide optical signal filtering for receivers. An mNoC reduces power consumption or enables scaling to larger crossbars for a reduced energy budget compared to current nanophotonic NoC crossbars. Since communication latency is reduced by using a high-radix crossbar, minimizing power consumption becomes a primary design target. Conventional Single Writer Multiple Reader (SWMR) photonic crossbar designs broadcast all packets, and incur the commensurate required power, even if only two nodes are communicating.This paper introduces power topologies, enabled by unique capabilities of mNoC technology, to reduce overall interconnect power consumption. A power topology corresponds to the logical connectivity provided by a given power mode. Broadcast is one power mode and it consumes the maximum power. Additional power modes consume less power but allow a source to communicate with only a statically defined, potentially non-contiguous, subset of nodes. Overall interconnect power is reduced if the more frequently communicating nodes use modes that consume less power, while less frequently communicating nodes use modes that consume more power. We also investigate thread mapping techniques to fully exploit power topologies. We explore various mNoC power topologies with one, two and four power modes for a radix-256 SWMR mNoC crossbar. Our results show that the combination of power topologies and intelligent thread mapping can reduce total mNoC power by up to 51% on average for a set of 12 SPLASH benchmarks. Furthermore performance is 10% better than conventional resonator-based photonic NoCs and energy is reduced by 72%.},

These faults are predicted to become more frequent in future systems that contain orders of magnitude more DRAM and SRAM than found in current memory subsystems. These memory subsystems will need to provide resilience techniques to tolerate these faults when deployed in high-performance computing systems and data centers containing tens of thousands of nodes. Therefore, it is critical to understand the efficacy of current hardware resilience techniques to determine whether they will be suitable for future systems. In this paper, we present a study of DRAM and SRAM faults and errors from the field. We use data from two leadership-class high-performance computer systems to analyze the reliability impact of hardware resilience schemes that are deployed in current systems. Our study has several key findings about the efficacy of many currently deployed reliability techniques such as DRAM ECC, DDR address/command parity, and SRAM ECC and parity. We also perform a methodological study, and find that counting errors instead of faults, a common practice among researchers and data center operators, can lead to incorrect conclusions about system reliability. Finally, we use our data to project the needs of future large-scale systems. We find that SRAM faults are unlikely to pose a significantly larger reliability threat in the future, while DRAM faults will be a major concern and stronger DRAM resilience schemes will be needed to maintain acceptable failure rates similar to those found on today's systems.},

By converting potentially catastrophic communication errors into potentially tolerable data errors, CommGuard allows important streaming applications like JPEG and MP3 decoding to execute without crashing and to sustain good output quality, even for errors as frequent as every 500Î¼s.},

abstract = {Execution comparison has many applications in debugging, malware analysis, software feature identification, and intrusion detection. Existing comparison techniques have various limitations. Some can only compare at the system event level and require executions to take the same input. Some require storing instruction traces that are very space-consuming and have difficulty dealing with non-determinism. In this paper, we propose a novel dual execution technique that allows on-the-fly comparison at the instruction level. Only differences between the executions are recorded. It allows executions to proceed in a coupled mode such that they share the same input sequence with the same timing, reducing nondeterminism. It also allows them to proceed in a decoupled mode such that the user can interact with each one differently. Decoupled executions can be recoupled to share the same future inputs and facilitate further comparison. We have implemented a prototype and applied it to identifying functional components for reuse, comparative debugging with new GDB primitives, and understanding real world regression failures. Our results show that dual execution is a critical enabling technique for execution comparison.},

abstract = {The IOMMU allows the OS to encapsulate I/O devices in their own virtual memory spaces, thus restricting their DMAs to specific memory pages. The OS uses the IOMMU to protect itself against buggy drivers and malicious/errant devices. But the added protection comes at a cost, degrading the throughput of I/O-intensive workloads by up to an order of magnitude. This cost has motivated system designers to trade off some safety for performance, e.g., by leaving stale information in the IOTLB for a while so as to amortize costly invalidations. We observe that high-bandwidth devices---like network and PCIe SSD controllers---interact with the OS via circular ring buffers that induce a sequential, predictable workload. We design a ring IOMMU (rIOMMU) that leverages this characteristic by replacing the virtual memory page table hierarchy with a circular, flat table. A flat table is adequately supported by exactly one IOTLB entry, making every new translation an implicit invalidation of the former and thus requiring explicit invalidations only at the end of I/O bursts. Using standard networking benchmarks, we show that rIOMMU provides up to 7.56x higher throughput relative to the baseline IOMMU, and that it is within 0.77--1.00x the throughput of a system without IOMMU protection.},

abstract = {We propose and evaluate a framework for creating and running approximation-enabled MapReduce programs. Specifically, we propose approximation mechanisms that fit naturally into the MapReduce paradigm, including input data sampling, task dropping, and accepting and running a precise and a user-defined approximate version of the MapReduce code. We then show how to leverage statistical theories to compute error bounds for popular classes of MapReduce programs when approximating with input data sampling and/or task dropping. We implement the proposed mechanisms and error bound estimations in a prototype system called ApproxHadoop. Our evaluation uses MapReduce applications from different domains, including data analytics, scientific computing, video encoding, and machine learning. Our results show that ApproxHadoop can significantly reduce application execution time and/or energy consumption when the user is willing to tolerate small errors. For example, ApproxHadoop can reduce runtimes by up to 32x when the user can tolerate an error of 1% with 95% confidence. We conclude that our framework and system can make approximation easily accessible to many application domains using the MapReduce model.},

abstract = {Quantum computing (QC) offers huge promise to accelerate a range of computationally intensive benchmarks. Quantum computing is limited, however, by the challenges of decoherence: i.e., a quantum state can only be maintained for short windows of time before it decoheres. While quantum error correction codes can protect against decoherence, fast execution time is the best defense against decoherence, so efficient architectures and effective scheduling algorithms are necessary. This paper proposes the Multi-SIMD QC architecture and then proposes and evaluates effective schedulers to map benchmark descriptions onto Multi-SIMD architectures. The Multi-SIMD model consists of a small number of SIMD regions, each of which may support operations on up to thousands of qubits per cycle.Efficient Multi-SIMD operation requires efficient scheduling. This work develops schedulers to reduce communication requirements of qubits between operating regions, while also improving parallelism.We find that communication to global memory is a dominant cost in QC. We also note that many quantum benchmarks have long serial operation paths (although each operation may be data parallel). To exploit this characteristic, we introduce Longest-Path-First Scheduling (LPFS) which pins operations to SIMD regions to keep data in-place and reduce communication to memory. The use of small, local scratchpad memories also further reduces communication. Our results show a 3% to 308% improvement for LPFS over conventional scheduling algorithms, and an additional 3% to 64% improvement using scratchpad memories. Our work is the most comprehensive software-to-quantum toolflow published to date, with efficient and practical scheduling techniques that reduce communication and increase parallelism for full-scale quantum code executing up to a trillion quantum gate operations.},

abstract = {Quantum computing (QC) offers huge promise to accelerate a range of computationally intensive benchmarks. Quantum computing is limited, however, by the challenges of decoherence: i.e., a quantum state can only be maintained for short windows of time before it decoheres. While quantum error correction codes can protect against decoherence, fast execution time is the best defense against decoherence, so efficient architectures and effective scheduling algorithms are necessary. This paper proposes the Multi-SIMD QC architecture and then proposes and evaluates effective schedulers to map benchmark descriptions onto Multi-SIMD architectures. The Multi-SIMD model consists of a small number of SIMD regions, each of which may support operations on up to thousands of qubits per cycle.Efficient Multi-SIMD operation requires efficient scheduling. This work develops schedulers to reduce communication requirements of qubits between operating regions, while also improving parallelism.We find that communication to global memory is a dominant cost in QC. We also note that many quantum benchmarks have long serial operation paths (although each operation may be data parallel). To exploit this characteristic, we introduce Longest-Path-First Scheduling (LPFS) which pins operations to SIMD regions to keep data in-place and reduce communication to memory. The use of small, local scratchpad memories also further reduces communication. Our results show a 3% to 308% improvement for LPFS over conventional scheduling algorithms, and an additional 3% to 64% improvement using scratchpad memories. Our work is the most comprehensive software-to-quantum toolflow published to date, with efficient and practical scheduling techniques that reduce communication and increase parallelism for full-scale quantum code executing up to a trillion quantum gate operations.},

We classified 7 years of errata from recent commercial processors to understand the magnitude and severity of this problem, and found that of 301 errata analyzed, 28 are security-critical. We propose the SECURITY-CRITICAL PROCESSOR ER- RATA CATCHING SYSTEM (SPECS) as a low-overhead solution to this problem. SPECS employs a dynamic verification strategy that is made lightweight by limiting protection to only security-critical processor state. As a proof-of- concept, we implement a hardware prototype of SPECS in an open source processor. Using this prototype, we evaluate SPECS against a set of 14 bugs inspired by the types of security-critical errata we discovered in the classification phase. The evaluation shows that SPECS is 86% effective as a defense when deployed using only ISA-level state; incurs less than 5% area and power overhead; and has no software run-time overhead.},

abstract = {The demand for multitasking on graphics processing units (GPUs) is constantly increasing as they have become one of the default components on modern computer systems along with traditional processors (CPUs). Preemptive multitasking on CPUs has been primarily supported through context switching. However, the same preemption strategy incurs substantial overhead due to the large context in GPUs. The overhead comes in two dimensions: a preempting kernel suffers from a long preemption latency, and the system throughput is wasted during the switch. Without precise control over the large preemption overhead, multitasking on GPUs has little use for applications with strict latency requirements.In this paper, we propose Chimera, a collaborative preemption approach that can precisely control the overhead for multitasking on GPUs. Chimera first introduces streaming multiprocessor (SM) flushing, which can instantly preempt an SM by detecting and exploiting idempotent execution. Chimera utilizes flushing collaboratively with two previously proposed preemption techniques for GPUs, namely context switching and draining to minimize throughput overhead while achieving a required preemption latency. Evaluations show that Chimera violates the deadline for only 0.2% of preemption requests when a 15us preemption latency constraint is used. For multi-programmed workloads, Chimera can improve the average normalized turnaround time by 5.5x, and system throughput by 12.2%.},

abstract = {The demand for multitasking on graphics processing units (GPUs) is constantly increasing as they have become one of the default components on modern computer systems along with traditional processors (CPUs). Preemptive multitasking on CPUs has been primarily supported through context switching. However, the same preemption strategy incurs substantial overhead due to the large context in GPUs. The overhead comes in two dimensions: a preempting kernel suffers from a long preemption latency, and the system throughput is wasted during the switch. Without precise control over the large preemption overhead, multitasking on GPUs has little use for applications with strict latency requirements.In this paper, we propose Chimera, a collaborative preemption approach that can precisely control the overhead for multitasking on GPUs. Chimera first introduces streaming multiprocessor (SM) flushing, which can instantly preempt an SM by detecting and exploiting idempotent execution. Chimera utilizes flushing collaboratively with two previously proposed preemption techniques for GPUs, namely context switching and draining to minimize throughput overhead while achieving a required preemption latency. Evaluations show that Chimera violates the deadline for only 0.2% of preemption requests when a 15us preemption latency constraint is used. For multi-programmed workloads, Chimera can improve the average normalized turnaround time by 5.5x, and system throughput by 12.2%.},

abstract = {Systems from smartphones to supercomputers are increasingly heterogeneous, being composed of both CPUs and GPUs. To maximize cost and energy efficiency, these systems will increasingly use globally-addressable heterogeneous memory systems, making choices about memory page placement critical to performance. In this work we show that current page placement policies are not sufficient to maximize GPU performance in these heterogeneous memory systems. We propose two new page placement policies that improve GPU performance: one application agnostic and one using application profile information. Our application agnostic policy, bandwidth-aware (BW-AWARE) placement, maximizes GPU throughput by balancing page placement across the memories based on the aggregate memory bandwidth available in a system. Our simulation-based results show that BW-AWARE placement outperforms the existing Linux INTERLEAVE and LOCAL policies by 35% and 18% on average for GPU compute workloads. We build upon BW-AWARE placement by developing a compiler-based profiling mechanism that provides programmers with information about GPU application data structure access patterns. Combining this information with simple program-annotated hints about memory placement, our hint-based page placement approach performs within 90% of oracular page placement on average, largely mitigating the need for costly dynamic page tracking and migration.},

abstract = {On contemporary cache-coherent Non-Uniform Memory Access (ccNUMA) architectures, applications with a large memory footprint suffer from the cost of the garbage collector (GC), because, as the GC scans the reference graph, it makes many remote memory accesses, saturating the interconnect between memory nodes. We address this problem with NumaGiC, a GC with a mostly-distributed design. In order to maximise memory access locality during collection, a GC thread avoids accessing a different memory node, instead notifying a remote GC thread with a message; nonetheless, NumaGiC avoids the drawbacks of a pure distributed design, which tends to decrease parallelism. We compare NumaGiC with Parallel Scavenge and NAPS on two different ccNUMA architectures running on the Hotspot Java Virtual Machine of OpenJDK 7. On Spark and Neo4j, two industry-strength analytics applications, with heap sizes ranging from 160GB to 350GB, and on SPECjbb2013 and SPECjbb2005, ourgc improves overall performance by up to 45% over NAPS (up to 94% over Parallel Scavenge), and increases the performance of the collector itself by up to 3.6x over NAPS (up to 5.4x over Parallel Scavenge).},

abstract = {On contemporary cache-coherent Non-Uniform Memory Access (ccNUMA) architectures, applications with a large memory footprint suffer from the cost of the garbage collector (GC), because, as the GC scans the reference graph, it makes many remote memory accesses, saturating the interconnect between memory nodes. We address this problem with NumaGiC, a GC with a mostly-distributed design. In order to maximise memory access locality during collection, a GC thread avoids accessing a different memory node, instead notifying a remote GC thread with a message; nonetheless, NumaGiC avoids the drawbacks of a pure distributed design, which tends to decrease parallelism. We compare NumaGiC with Parallel Scavenge and NAPS on two different ccNUMA architectures running on the Hotspot Java Virtual Machine of OpenJDK 7. On Spark and Neo4j, two industry-strength analytics applications, with heap sizes ranging from 160GB to 350GB, and on SPECjbb2013 and SPECjbb2005, ourgc improves overall performance by up to 45% over NAPS (up to 94% over Parallel Scavenge), and increases the performance of the collector itself by up to 3.6x over NAPS (up to 5.4x over Parallel Scavenge).},

abstract = {The past decade has witnessed the increasing demands on data-driven business intelligence that led to the proliferation of data-intensive applications. A managed object-oriented programming language such as Java is often the developer's choice for implementing such applications, due to its quick development cycle and rich community resource. While the use of such languages makes programming easier, their automated memory management comes at a cost. When the managed runtime meets Big Data, this cost is significantly magnified and becomes a scalability-prohibiting bottleneck. This paper presents a novel compiler framework, called Facade, that can generate highly-efficient data manipulation code by automatically transforming the data path of an existing Big Data application. The key treatment is that in the generated code, the number of runtime heap objects created for data types in each thread is (almost) statically bounded, leading to significantly reduced memory management cost and improved scalability. We have implemented Facade and used it to transform 7 common applications on 3 real-world, already well-optimized Big Data frameworks: GraphChi, Hyracks, and GPS. Our experimental results are very positive: the generated programs have (1) achieved a 3%--48% execution time reduction and an up to 88X GC reduction; (2) consumed up to 50% less memory, and (3) scaled to much larger datasets.},

abstract = {All software in use today relies on libraries, including standard libraries (e.g., C, C++) and application-specific libraries (e.g., libxml, libpng). Most libraries are loaded in memory and dynamically linked when programs are launched, resolving symbol addresses across the applications and libraries. Dynamic linking has many benefits: It allows code to be reused between applications, conserves memory (because only one copy of a library is kept in memory for all the applications that share it), and allows libraries to be patched and updated without modifying programs, among numerous other benefits. However, these benefits come at the cost of performance. For every call made to a function in a dynamically linked library, a trampoline is used to read the function address from a lookup table and branch to the function, incurring memory load and branch operations. Static linking avoids this performance penalty, but loses all the benefits of dynamic linking. Given its myriad benefits, dynamic linking is the predominant choice today, despite the performance cost. In this work, we propose a speculative hardware mechanism to optimize dynamic linking by avoiding executing the trampolines for library function calls, providing the benefits of dynamic linking with the performance of static linking. Speculatively skipping the memory load and branch operations of the library call trampolines improves performance by reducing the number of executed instructions and gains additional performance by reducing pressure on the instruction and data caches, TLBs, and branch predictors. Because the indirect targets of library call trampolines do not change during program execution, our speculative mechanism never misspeculates in practice. We evaluate our technique on real hardware with production software and observe up to 4% speedup using only 1.5KB of on-chip storage.},
